# Booking Application

## Description
This Booking Application is a web platform that allows users to book hotels online. Built with **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React + Vite** for the frontend, the application enables users to search for hotels, make reservations, and manage bookings seamlessly.

### Motivation
The project was developed to provide a user-friendly and secure hotel booking system, enhancing the experience of both customers and rental providers.

### Why was this built?
This project was created to simplify the process of hotel booking by offering a modern user interface, robust authentication, and a seamless reservation experience.

### Problem it solves
The system addresses issues such as spam registrations, inefficient booking management, lack of real-time availability checks, and seamless online payment integration.

### What did I learn?
Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Implementing **JWT authentication** for secure API communication.
- Integrating **email confirmation** and **password recovery**.
- Utilizing **React + Vite** for a fast and optimized frontend.
- Managing real-time hotel availability and search suggestions.
- Implementing **online payment** for deposits and full payments.
- Handling **multi-role access control** for users, rentals, and admins.
